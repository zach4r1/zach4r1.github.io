			<p>
				The affinity diagram explains problems, potential solutions, constants, and potential ideas that can fix the issue of our unwalkable city.
Cluster 1: Physically fixable issues
Cluster 2: Constants that can never be "fixed"
Cluster 3: Fixes for potential issues that cause the City of Columbia to be hard to walk in
Cluster 4: Potential solutions for this problem via adding new things.
Cluster 5: Potential inventions that can remedy issues with constants (e.g, weather, traffic, construction)
